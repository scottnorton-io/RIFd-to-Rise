# SkimLearn Lesson 2: The Core Four

**Great businesses have four anchors. You need all four.**

1. **Skill** – What can you do that people will pay for?  
2. **Audience** – Who needs that skill *right now*?  
3. **Offer** – Can you package that skill into a service or product?  
4. **Delivery** – How will you consistently show up and deliver?

**Key Insight**:  
You don’t need a perfect business—just a clear, simple offer that helps someone *today*.
