# SkimLearn Lesson 1: The Gut Check

**Before you start an LLC or launch a business, ask yourself three honest questions:**

> 1. Why do I want to start a business *right now*?  
> 2. If no one paid me for 6 months, would I *still* want to do this?  
> 3. Am I craving freedomâ€”or fleeing a feeling?

**Key Insight**:  
The *why* matters more than the idea. If you're escaping pain instead of chasing purpose, take a pause.

**Next Step**: Reflect in your journal or use our [Mental Reset Journal](05-mental-reset-journal.md).
