1. WELCOME + SETUP

“You’ve just experienced a layoff. That sucks. But here you are, still standing—and wondering if this might be the moment to bet on yourself.

You might have heard: ‘Start an LLC. It looks good on a resume.’ Maybe. But running a business is a real decision—not just a placeholder. This experience is about helping you figure that out.

Let’s take a walk together. One step at a time. No pressure. Total honesty. Ready?”

[Proceed to Founder’s Self-Interview]

2. THE FOUNDER’S SELF-INTERVIEW

SECTION A: Gut Check
	•	Why do you want to start a business right now?
	•	If no one paid you for 6 months, would you still want to do this?
	•	Are you craving freedom—or are you fleeing a feeling?

SECTION B: The Core Four
	1.	Skill – What can you do that people will pay for?
	2.	Audience – Who needs that skill right now?
	3.	Offer – Can you package that skill into a service or product?
	4.	Delivery – How will you consistently show up and deliver that offer?

SECTION C: Brutal Reality
	•	Can you cover your bills for the next 3–6 months without income?
	•	How do you feel about rejection, crickets, and constant learning?
	•	Do you have the energy for sales, operations, finance, marketing—and your craft?

3. DECISION PATH: CHOOSE YOUR TRACK

Based on your honest answers, you’re invited to choose one of two paths.
There is no “right” answer—only your answer.

Track 1: Build the Business

“You’ve got the spark, and you’re ready to explore this for real. Welcome to the Builder Track.”

Go to → 10-Day Jumpstart Plan

⸻

Track 2: Reinvent Without the Risk

“You’re entrepreneurial—but not everyone should turn that into a business. You can still craft a story that shows initiative and direction.”

Go to → Alternative Reinvention Plan

⸻

4. TRACK 1 – 10-DAY BUSINESS BUILDER PLAN

Day	Focus	Action
1	Clarify Your Value	Define what problem you solve, who it’s for, and why it matters. Write a 1-line offer.
2	Choose Your Business Structure	Form an LLC or register as a sole proprietor in your state (if needed).
3	Set Up Your Digital Home	Buy a domain, create a simple landing page (Carrd, Notion, or Typedream).
4	Build a Simple Offer Stack	Create 1–2 offerings (e.g., Strategy Call, Starter Package). Keep it simple.
5	Make a Contact List	Identify 25 people to reach out to for feedback or introductions.
6	Launch Your Story	Post your story + offer on LinkedIn. Be real, not salesy.
7	Reach Out	Personally message your 25 contacts. Ask for advice or interest, not favors.
8	Create 3 Helpful Pieces of Content	Write short posts or emails that teach or inspire. Start showing up.
9	Rehearse Sales Conversations	Practice a simple discovery call script. Get feedback from a friend.
10	Secure First Call or Win	Your goal is 1 paid engagement or 1 serious conversation. Reflect, refine, repeat.

5. TRACK 2 – THE REINVENTION PLAN (HIGH-INTEGRITY OPTION)

“Consulting LLCs can look good on a resume—but they shouldn’t be a cover story for despair. Here’s a smarter way to show initiative without faking entrepreneurship.”

Your Reinvention Plan:
	1.	Update Resume and LinkedIn:
	•	Title: Independent Consultant (2025 – Present)
	•	Description: “Supporting X, exploring opportunities in Y.”
	2.	Craft Your Message:
	•	“After leaving [Company], I’ve been doing [X short-term work / learning], while looking for the right next opportunity where I can create meaningful impact.”
	3.	Join a Community:
	•	You’re not alone. Plug into peer groups, job seeker cohorts, or industry Slack/Discord spaces. This is your team now.
	4.	Volunteer or Contribute:
	•	Pick one way to stay active—open source, fractional help, pro bono advising. Keeps your story strong and your confidence intact.
	5.	Apply Smart, Not Spray:
	•	Only apply where you can customize your story. Use your current phase (consulting, transition) as part of your edge.

6. FINAL ENCOURAGEMENT + RESOURCES

Whether you start a business or not, one truth remains: You are not your job.
You are your skill, your story, your resilience, your kindness.

Layoffs suck. But sometimes they unlock a part of you that never got airtime.

You don’t have to prove anything to anyone. But if you want to build something—you can.
If you want to rest and regrow—you’re wise.

Whatever you do: Own your story. That’s the real power.

Bonus Tools You Can Add:
	•	Resume + LinkedIn templates for “consultant during transition”
	•	Sales script generator
	•	“First 3 clients” outreach planner
	•	Burn rate calculator (for business viability)
	•	Emotional resilience check-in (daily affirmations or journaling prompts)

## 🧠 Closing Self-Note

**Refresh often. Forget nothing. Hallucinate never.**
Schedule checkpoint reviews (weekly during build, monthly during usage). Revisit assumptions. Watch for scope creep and data drift.
