# Discovery Call Script

This is a non-salesy, service-oriented script to help you through early client conversations.

## Call Structure

### 1. **Warm Welcome**
- “Thanks for taking the time—excited to learn more about what you're working on.”

### 2. **Learn About Them**
- “Tell me about your biggest priority right now.”
- “What’s working? What’s been frustrating?”

### 3. **Talk About Your Work**
- “Here’s how I help clients in similar situations…”
- Share a brief story or relevant example.

### 4. **Invite Next Step**
- “If you’d find it helpful, I can send over a simple summary and we can go from there.”

### 5. **Wrap Up**
- “Either way, I really appreciated the chat—happy to be a resource.”

**Note**: No pressure. Make it about learning, not closing.
