**You were part of something big. Maybe CrowdStrike. Maybe somewhere else.**  
And then—RIF’d. Restructured. Laid off.  

No matter the spin, it still stings.  
But here you are—still standing. Still thinking.  

**“Is this my moment to start a business?”**  
This guide helps you answer that—honestly.

## Why This Exists

Every layoff is followed by a chorus of advice:  
> “Just start an LLC.”  
> “Say you're a consultant. It looks good.”  
> “Now’s the time to bet on yourself.”

Maybe.  
But **starting a business isn’t just a resume move**—it’s a real decision.  
This guide is your clear, empowering walk through that choice.

<summary><strong>What You'll Find Inside</strong></summary>

### 1. **Welcome + Setup**  
A quick grounding check. Let’s shake off the pressure and start with clarity.

### 2. **The Founder’s Self-Interview**  
A series of gut-level questions:
- Why *really* do you want this?
- Can you go 6 months unpaid?
- Are you chasing a dream—or escaping a feeling?

### 3. **Decision Path**  
Two possible tracks:
- **Build the Business**  
  > A no-fluff, 10-day jumpstart plan to test your idea fast.
- **Reinvent Without the Risk**  
  > A path to reposition yourself, not fake entrepreneurship.

### 4. **Next Steps + Encouragement**  
Practical. Grounded. Human.  
You’ll walk away with a clear action plan.
