## Welcome + Setup

You’ve just experienced a layoff. That sucks.  
But here you are—still standing—and wondering if this might be the moment to bet on yourself.

You might have heard: “Start an LLC. It looks good on a resume.” Maybe. But running a business is a real decision—not just a placeholder.

This guide helps you figure that out. No pressure. Total honesty.

**Let’s take a walk together. One step at a time.**

## The Founder’s Self-Interview

### SECTION A: Gut Check

- **Why do you want to start a business right now?**
- **If no one paid you for 6 months, would you still want to do this?**
- **Are you craving freedom—or are you fleeing a feeling?**

### SECTION B: The Core Four

1. **Skill** – What can you do that people will pay for?
2. **Audience** – Who needs that skill right now?
3. **Offer** – Can you package that skill into a service or product?
4. **Delivery** – How will you consistently show up and deliver that offer?

### SECTION C: Brutal Reality

- **Can you cover your bills for the next 3–6 months without income?**
- **How do you feel about rejection, crickets, and constant learning?**
- **Do you have the energy for sales, operations, finance, marketing—and your craft?**

## Track 2 – The Reinvention Plan (High-Integrity Option)

**Consulting LLCs can look good on a resume—but don’t fake it.**  
Here’s how to reinvent *without* pretending.

### Your Reinvention Plan

1. **Update Resume and LinkedIn**  
   - **Title:** Independent Consultant (2025 – Present)  
   - **Description:** “Supporting X, exploring opportunities in Y.”

2. **Craft Your Message**  
   - “After leaving [Company], I’ve been doing [short-term work or learning] while looking for the right next opportunity to make an impact.”

3. **Join a Community**  
   - Peer groups, job seeker cohorts, industry Slack/Discord spaces.

4. **Volunteer or Contribute**  
   - Open source, fractional help, pro bono work—keep active and confident.

5. **Apply Smart, Not Spray**  
   - Customize applications. Use your *current* phase as part of your edge.

## Final Encouragement + Resources

Whether you start a business or not, one truth remains: **You are not your job.**

You are your skill, your story, your resilience, your kindness.

Layoffs suck. But sometimes they unlock a part of you that never got airtime.

You don’t have to prove anything. But if you want to build something—you can.  
If you want to rest and regrow—you’re wise.

**Own your story. That’s the real power.**
